# Python List Manipulation Program
This Python script demonstrates basic list operations, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, and sorting elements. The script walks through several operations on a list (my_list) and prints the results at each step.

## How It Works
The program performs the following operations sequentially:

1. Create an empty list:
Initializes an empty list called my_list and prints it.

2. Append elements:
Appends the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to my_list and prints the updated list.

3. Insert an element:
Inserts the value 15 at the second position (index 1) in the list and prints the updated list.

4. Extend the list:
Extends my_list by adding elements from another list [50, 60, 70] and prints the updated list.


5. Remove the last element:
Removes the last element of my_list using the pop() method and prints the updated list.

6. Sort the list:
Sorts my_list in ascending order.

7. Find an index:
Finds and prints the index of the value 30 in my_list.

## Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your system.
## How to Run
Download or copy the script to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script by typing:
  python <script_name>.py
## Notes
The list operations performed in this script are basic examples of list manipulation in Python.
